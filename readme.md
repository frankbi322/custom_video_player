Custom HTML Video player

This is a HTML video player that aims to replicate various functionalities of common video players like the ones found on Youtube, Vimeo, etc. The various functionalities are added using Javascript.

Functions:
**Play/Pause button: toggles whether the video is playing or paused
**Local Storage: Uses localStorage to periodically store the video's current time. If the user refreshes the page or revisits it later on, the video will start from where the user left off.
**
**Skip forward/back buttons: goes back 10 seconds (or start of video if it would go negative) or forward 25 seconds
**Range select: allows users to navigate to any point of video using a css slider.
**Volume and Playback speed sliders: allows users to adjust volume and playback speed using css sliders.
